We recently had the pleasure of sitting down with the rising star **'Rootsman Vibration'**, whose unique blend of traditional roots reggae and modern sounds is making waves in the Indonesian music scene. We talked about his journey, inspirations, and what's next for his music.

### Finding the Rhythm

*'Rootsman Vibration'* (real name Agung Prasetyo) shared how his love for reggae began. "It started with my uncle's cassette collection," he recalls. "Bob Marley, Peter Tosh... their messages of peace, love, and resistance resonated deeply with me. It wasn't just music; it was a way of life."

He started playing guitar in high school, initially drawn to rock, but soon found himself gravitating back to the infectious rhythms of reggae. "The basslines, the one-drop beat â€“ it just felt natural," he explains.

### The State of Indonesian Reggae

We asked for his perspective on the current reggae scene in Indonesia.

> "It's vibrant and diverse! There are so many talented artists exploring different subgenres, from classic roots to dub and dancehall influences. The community is strong, and there's a real sense of brotherhood."

However, he also noted challenges, such as the need for more platforms and wider recognition for local artists. "We need more dedicated venues, more media coverage, and continued support from the fans to help the scene grow even stronger."

### Upcoming EP: 'Island Soul'

'Rootsman Vibration' is currently in the studio working on his debut EP, titled **'Island Soul'**. He describes the project as "a reflection of my experiences growing up near the coast, infused with the spiritual messages of reggae."

The EP is expected to feature five original tracks, blending soulful melodies with conscious lyrics. Fans can anticipate its release in early 2025.

Inspired by the messages of unity, respect for nature, and community spirit often found in reggae music, a group of dedicated fans calling themselves **'Pantai Positif Collective'** organized a highly successful beach cleanup event last weekend at Parangtritis Beach, Yogyakarta.

## More Than Just Music

Over 50 volunteers, fueled by reggae tunes playing softly in the background, spent Saturday morning collecting trash and debris that had washed ashore or been left behind. Armed with gloves and biodegradable bags, they worked tirelessly under the morning sun.

"Reggae music teaches us about 'One Love' and respecting Mother Earth," said Rina Wijaya, one of the event organizers. "We felt it was important to put those principles into action. Our beaches are precious, and we wanted to do our part to keep them clean for everyone."

## Positive Impact

The initiative collected over 100 large bags of waste, primarily consisting of plastic bottles, food wrappers, and fishing nets. The collected waste was sorted for recycling where possible, with the remainder being properly disposed of through coordination with local authorities.

Key outcomes:

*   Significant reduction of visible litter on the main beach area.
*   Increased awareness among beachgoers about waste management.
*   Strengthened sense of community among local reggae fans.

> "It was amazing to see everyone working together with such positive energy. It shows that the reggae community cares deeply about our environment," added volunteer Budi Santoso.

The 'Pantai Positif Collective' plans to organize similar cleanup events quarterly and hopes to inspire other fan communities across Indonesia to take similar actions. They believe that small, consistent efforts can make a big difference.

Reggae music, born in Jamaica, has found a welcoming and fertile ground in the diverse archipelago of Indonesia. Its journey here is a fascinating story of cultural exchange, local adaptation, and the enduring appeal of its rhythms and messages.

## Early Seeds (1980s - 1990s)

While international reggae icons like Bob Marley gained global fame, the seeds of Indonesian reggae were planted somewhat later. Influences arrived through:

*   **Travelers and Tourists:** Especially in destinations like Bali, visitors brought reggae music, influencing local musicians.
*   **Returning Students/Workers:** Indonesians studying or working abroad brought back reggae records and cassettes.
*   **Underground Scenes:** Small communities and university circles began experimenting with reggae sounds. Early pioneers often blended reggae with existing Indonesian pop or rock sensibilities.

## The Growth Spurt (2000s)

The new millennium saw a significant rise in the popularity and visibility of Indonesian reggae.

*   **Breakout Artists:** Bands like **Shaggydog** (Yogyakarta, blending ska/reggae/rock), **Steven & Coconut Treez** (Jakarta, popularizing acoustic/beach reggae), and **Tony Q Rastafara** (often dubbed the 'Godfather' of Indonesian reggae) achieved mainstream recognition.
*   **Festivals Emerge:** Dedicated reggae festivals and events started appearing, providing platforms for artists and building the community.
*   **Regional Scenes:** Strong local scenes developed in various cities like Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Bali, and parts of Sumatra and Eastern Indonesia, each with its unique flavor.

## Modern Diversity (2010s - Present)

Today, the Indonesian reggae scene is incredibly diverse:

*   **Subgenre Exploration:** Artists delve into roots, dub, dancehall, ska, rocksteady, and fusions with traditional Indonesian music (like gamelan or ethnic rhythms).
*   **Digital Age:** Social media and streaming platforms allow artists to reach wider audiences independently.
*   **Conscious Messages:** Many artists continue the tradition of using reggae to convey messages of peace, social justice, environmental awareness, and cultural pride.

> The evolution continues, with new artists constantly emerging and pushing the boundaries. Indonesian reggae is not just an import; it's a living, breathing part of the nation's musical landscape.

From humble beginnings to a nationwide movement, Indonesian reggae showcases the power of music to cross borders and resonate with the local spirit. Its future looks bright and full of rhythm.
